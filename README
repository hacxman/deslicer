Remote slic3r service + client.

Be sure to set the same apikey in /etc/deslicer.conf
at server side and in $HOME/.deslicer.

You need to set server address in $HOME/.deslicer.
Server listens on AF_INET6. The format for entering
IPv6 address with port is similar to one used in web browsers,
i.e. server=[IP6ADDR]:PORT or without port server=IP6ADDR,
where IP6ADDR could be valid numeric address or DNS name.
